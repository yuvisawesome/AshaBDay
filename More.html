      <p class="shorten " style="font-size: 1.5rem;">So.. Today is finally your <strong>Birthday</strong>.. I am sorry for not doing a lot.. I thought that this website would be easy to make.... <br> I made this website because I wanted to make something special and something new for you. You deserve the best but I had to make this in a hurry so its not that good. <br> I wanted to thank you for all that you have done for me and also for Saachi. You are the best Mom anyone can <strong>ever</strong> ask for. I remember how you have always helped me whenever I needed help; I didn't finish my homework, you would sit with me and make sure that I complete it even if you are very sleepy.. I can't tell how much you comfort me whenever you are near (except for when you scold us ðŸ¤ª.) Now because of the <em>annoying</em> online classes, we aren't able to play anymore.. Finish reading this then I will beat you at Othelo ðŸ™ƒ. <em>(Don't forget.. Today is a Friday which means that tommorow is a <strong>HOLIDAY!</strong>..)</em> <br> <br> <strong><em>HAPPY BIRTHDAY MUMMA!!!!!!!!!!!! <br> I LOVE YOU! <br> YOU ARE THE BEST! </em></strong></p>
